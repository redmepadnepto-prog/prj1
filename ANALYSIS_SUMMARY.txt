LICENSE SYSTEM


FILE LOCATION

Path: /data/user/0/<UID>/files/Key.lic
Format: AES-256-CBC encrypted JSON
Signature: RSA-2048

VALIDATION PROCESS

1. File existence check
2. AES-256 decryption (embedded key)
3. JSON parsing
4. RSA signature verification
5. Expiration timestamp check
6. HWID device fingerprint validation
7. SHA-256 checksum verification

ANY FAILURE → kill(getpid())


SECURITY ASSESSMENT


PROTECTION STRENGTHS

 Multi-layer independent protection
 Kernel-level termination (uninterceptable from userspace)
 Parallel validation systems
 Delayed crash mechanism (obfuscates debugging)
 Anti-debug, anti-frida, anti-xposed
 Memory integrity checks
 Mutual resurrection (DaemonService ↔ DaemonInnerService)
 Obfuscated protection library name
 Embedded cryptographic keys

ATTACK SURFACE

 Root + Frida hooking         - DETECTED by Level 3
 DEX patching                  - DETECTED by Level 2
 Native library patching       - DETECTED by Level 3
 License file forging          - REQUIRES private RSA key (impossible)
 Process suspension            - DEFEATED by Level 4 resurrection
 Debugger attachment           - DETECTED by Level 3
 Memory editing                - DETECTED by Level 3 & 4

BYPASS REQUIREMENTS

 Root access to device
 Ghidra/IDA Pro expertise
 ARM64 assembly patching skills
 Cryptographic key extraction
 Simultaneous bypass of all 5 levels
 Private RSA key (IMPOSSIBLE to obtain)

ESTIMATED TIME TO BYPASS: 3-6 months (expert-level)
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: < 5% (without private key, license forging impossible)


RISK ASSESSMENT


SECURITY RISKS

 HIGH:   Extensive privileges (VPN service, foreground services)
 MEDIUM: Opaque behavior (encrypted assets, obfuscated code)
 MEDIUM: Network traffic interception capability
 LOW:    No evidence of malicious intent

PRIVACY CONCERNS

 VPN service can intercept all device traffic
 Background services running continuously
 Device fingerprinting (HWID)
 Encrypted communications (unknown destination)

ETHICAL CONCERNS

 Enables cheating in multiplayer games
 Violates game Terms of Service
 Provides unfair advantage
 Potentially harms gaming industry
